# Adventures-in-FORTRAN
Projects written in FORTRAN--accesory code written in Python

Contents:

0. write-xy.f95 : A simple FORTRAN Program that writes values to two files to be accesseble by a python program (read-and-plot.py)

1. read-and-plot.py: a simple python program that reads values two files generated by a FORTRAN program (write-xy.f95) and plots the values using matplotlib

2. euler-method.f95: Executes Euler's Method to solve first-order ODE; export results to .txt files to be analyzed/plotted with python
